We will build a simple color guessing game. Every time the game is started, 
a random RGB color code will be selected. Depending on the mode of the game, 
we will have three (easy) or six (hard) options or color blocks on the screen to choose from. 
Every time an incorrect color block is selected, 
the block will disappear until the user selects the correct color (or its the last option left).
